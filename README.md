Storyflow
=========

The Storyflow widget transforms the so called “related stories” on news sites and blogs into visual timelines, allowing the reader to quickly grasp the bigger picture behind any news story.

The Storyflow project was one of [five finalists](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/technology/five-start-up-firms-shortlisted-for-irish-times-digital-challenge-1.532783) at the 2012 IrishTimes Digital Challenge and the widget was running on [irishtimes.com](http://www.irishtimes.com) throughout the year 2012.
Due to the varying topic models across different news organisations, it has been decided to suspend commercial operations with the project for now and release the widget under an open source license for any one interested in it.

Note that the widget can be used in conjunction with sophisticated topic extraction or named entity recognition tools, but also simple tags and categories.

For a demo, check out our homepage at [storyflow.net](http://storyflow.net).

For questions, suggestions and general comments, feel invited to open an issue on github, or contact me directly at martin@webscio.net.
